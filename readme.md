# Hybrid Authentication System

This repository contains implementation work for my Honours Dissertation.

The project explores a hybrid authentication approach using Passkeys (WebAuthn) with fallback recovery mechanisms such as magic links** and backup codes.

The aim is to evaluate whether a passkey-first model with hardened recovery can improve security and usability compared to traditional password-based authentication.

This repository currently focuses on passkey enrolment (registration) as a proof-of-concept implementation.
